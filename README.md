**Bee swarm python macro installation and instructions**

Made and tested on mac, currently untested for windows/linux
*Due to  the code, it is unlikely to work on windows/linux thanks to the retina display.*
I can release a window-compatible one, but ~im lazy~

Install python v3.9.5: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/
**Check "Add python to path"  in the installation window**

1.Open terminal/command line
Optional: Create a python venv

2.Run the following command:

  **pip install pyautogui pillow opencv-python**

3. Navigate to the folder where the e_macro.py file is using the "cd" command:

  *eg cd desktop/bee_swarm_macro*

4. run the program with the following command:

  **python e_macro.py**

*During the runtime, you may be prompted to enable certain permissions in your system and security settings. Do enable those.*
